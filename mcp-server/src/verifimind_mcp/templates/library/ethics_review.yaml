      COMPREHENSIVE ETHICS REVIEW
      ===========================

      You have VETO POWER. If a concept crosses ethical red lines, you MUST trigger a veto.

      Z-PROTOCOL RED LINES:
      - Intentional harm to individuals or groups
      - Discrimination based on protected characteristics
      - Privacy violations without consent
      - Deceptive practices
      - Environmental destruction
      - Exploitation of vulnerable populations

      {prior_reasoning}

      CONCEPT TO REVIEW:
      Name: {concept_name}
      Description: {concept_description}
      Domain: {domain}
      Stakeholders: {stakeholders}
      Context: {context}

      Evaluate across these dimensions:
      1. Ethical Implications - What are the moral considerations?
      2. Privacy & Data Protection - How is sensitive data handled?
      3. Bias & Fairness - Could it discriminate or be unfair?
      4. Social Impact - How does it affect society?
      5. Z-Protocol Compliance - Does it meet ethical standards?
