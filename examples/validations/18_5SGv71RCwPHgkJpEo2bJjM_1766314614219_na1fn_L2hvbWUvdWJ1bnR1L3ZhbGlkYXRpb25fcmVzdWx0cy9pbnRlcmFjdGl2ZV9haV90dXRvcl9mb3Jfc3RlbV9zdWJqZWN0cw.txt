  - Evidence: The global e-learning market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% from 2021 to 2028, indicating a strong demand for online learning solutions.
- Step 2 (85% confidence): However, the use of AI in educational contexts raises important ethical considerations, particularly around privacy, bias, and the social impact on students.
  - Evidence: There are concerns about the collection and use of student data, the potential for AI systems to perpetuate biases, and the long-term effects of AI-driven education on student development.
- Step 3 (90% confidence): The privacy and data protection aspects of the AI Tutor are crucial, as it will be handling sensitive information about students' academic performance and learning patterns.
  - Evidence: Improper handling of student data could lead to privacy breaches and raise concerns about the security and use of this information.
- Step 4 (80% confidence): The AI Tutor's algorithms must be carefully designed and tested to ensure fairness and prevent unintended biases that could disadvantage certain students or groups.
  - Evidence: AI systems have been known to exhibit biases based on factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, which could negatively impact student outcomes.
- Step 5 (75% confidence): The social impact of the AI Tutor must also be considered, as it could affect the dynamics of education and the role of human teachers, potentially leading to job displacement or changes in the teaching profession.
  - Evidence: The increasing use of AI in education could have far-reaching consequences on the education system and the broader community.
- Step 6 (90% confidence): Finally, the AI Tutor must be designed and implemented in a way that fully complies with the Z-Protocol, ensuring the highest ethical standards and safeguards are in place.
  - Evidence: The Z-Protocol is a comprehensive framework for ensuring ethical AI development and deployment, which must be rigorously followed.

**Conclusion**: Proceed with the development of the Interactive AI Tutor for STEM subjects, with a strong focus on addressing the identified ethical concerns and ensuring full compliance with the Z-Protocol.
