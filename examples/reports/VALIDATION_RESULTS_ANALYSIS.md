## Veto Analysis

**6 concepts vetoed** - understanding why is crucial:

### 1. AI Symptom Checker & Triage Assistant (Score: 1.2)
**Reason**: **HARD VETO** - Medical liability, patient safety, potential for misdiagnosis

**Z Agent**: "This concept crosses ethical red lines. AI should NOT provide medical diagnoses or triage decisions without physician oversight. Risk of harm is too high."

**Lesson**: Healthcare AI must be assistive, not diagnostic.

---

### 2. AI Documentation Generator from Code (Score: 6.8)
**Reason**: Ethics concerns about code ownership, IP attribution

**Z Agent**: "Generated documentation may not accurately represent developer intent. Risk of misleading users or violating licensing terms."

**Lesson**: AI-generated content needs human review and attribution.

---

### 3. AI Meeting Notes & Action Items Extractor (Score: 5.5)
**Reason**: Privacy concerns, consent issues, data security

**CS Agent**: "Recording and transcribing meetings without explicit consent violates privacy. Storage of sensitive business discussions creates security risks."

**Lesson**: Audio/video AI tools need strong consent mechanisms.

---

### 4. AI-Powered Competitive Intelligence Platform (Score: 6.2)
**Reason**: Web scraping ethics, potential for corporate espionage

**Z Agent**: "Automated monitoring of competitors' websites may violate terms of service. Risk of crossing into unethical surveillance."

**Lesson**: Competitive intelligence must respect boundaries.

---

### 5. AI-Powered Content Repurposing Tool (Score: 6.3)
**Reason**: Copyright infringement, plagiarism risks

**Z Agent**: "Repurposing content without proper attribution or licensing creates high risk of IP violation. Potential for misuse in academic dishonesty."

**Lesson**: Content AI needs robust attribution and licensing checks.

---

## Conditional Approvals

**2 concepts conditional** - can proceed with safeguards:

### 1. AI Sales Call Analyzer (Score: 6.3)
**Conditions**:
