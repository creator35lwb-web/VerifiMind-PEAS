  # VerifiMind-PEAS Roadmap

  **Strategic Development Plan for Genesis Methodology Framework**

  **Version**: 2.0  
  **Last Updated**: December 11, 2025  
  **Status**: Methodology Framework Focus | Validation-First Approach

</div>

---

## Vision

**By 2027**: VerifiMind-PEAS becomes a **leading methodology framework** for multi-model AI validation, empowering knowledge creators worldwide to build validated, ethical, secure applications through human-centered orchestration.

**Core Philosophy**: Human-centered wisdom validation through systematic multi-model orchestration.

---

## Strategic Positioning

### What We Are

**VerifiMind-PEAS is a methodology framework**, not a code generation platform.

**We provide**:
- ✅ Systematic 5-step process (Genesis Methodology)
- ✅ X-Z-CS RefleXion Trinity (specialized agents)
- ✅ Genesis Master Prompts (stateful memory system)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and guides
- ✅ Integration with existing AI tools

**We do NOT provide**:
- ❌ Code generation platform
- ❌ Web interface for application scaffolding
- ❌ No-code platform integrations
- ❌ Automated deployment systems

### Competitive Advantage

**Industry Focus**: Code execution, task automation, agent coordination

**VerifiMind-PEAS Focus**: Wisdom validation, ethical alignment, human-centered orchestration

**Result**: We complement (not compete with) existing AI frameworks.

---

## Our Approach: Validation-First, Not Overbuilding

**We believe in**:
- ✅ **Validate demand before building** (listen to community)
- ✅ **Iterate based on feedback** (not assumptions)
- ✅ **Build what users need** (not what we think they need)
- ✅ **Maintain flexibility** (pivot when necessary)

**We avoid**:
- ❌ **Overbuilding features** without validation
- ❌ **Committing to dates** without certainty
- ❌ **Revealing strategy** to copycats
- ❌ **Creating pressure** with unrealistic targets

**This roadmap reflects our philosophy**: **Phase 1 is detailed (we're executing now), Phase 2-5 are high-level (we'll refine based on your feedback).**

### Phase 2: AI Agent Integrations (2026)

**Status**: Planning Phase 📋  
**Confidence**: MEDIUM (depends on Phase 1 validation)

**Goal**: Make VerifiMind-PEAS accessible within popular AI coding agents, based on community demand and feedback from Phase 1.

#### What We're Considering

**Potential Integrations**:
- Simple repository analysis (paste GitHub URL → LLM applies methodology)
- MCP server for automated integration (if validated by demand)
- Extensions for Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI agents
- Integration with Google Antigravity (when available)

**Potential Deliverables**:
- Enhanced integration guides
- Prompt templates and examples
- Video tutorials and workshops
- Community-contributed integrations

#### How We'll Decide What to Build

**We'll prioritize based on**:
1. **Community feedback**: What integrations do you need most?
2. **Adoption data**: Which AI tools are users actually using?
3. **Technical feasibility**: What can we realistically build?
4. **Resource availability**: What can we sustain as a solo builder?

**We'll share detailed plans** for Phase 2 in **Q1 2026** after gathering feedback from Phase 1.

#### How You Can Influence Phase 2

**Tell us**:
- Which AI tools do you use? (Claude Code, Cursor, Kimi, Grok, Gemini, etc.)
- What integration would help you most?
- What challenges do you face applying the methodology?
- What features would make your workflow easier?

- ✅ **Community-driven** (you influence our direction)

### How This Roadmap Will Evolve

**We'll update this roadmap**:
- **Quarterly**: Based on progress and community feedback
- **Transparently**: Changes will be documented in CHANGELOG.md
- **Collaboratively**: Major changes will be discussed with community

**We'll share detailed plans for each phase**:
- **Phase 2**: Q1 2026 (after Phase 1 validation)
- **Phase 3**: Q2 2026 (after Phase 2 validation)
- **Phase 4**: Q3 2026 (after Phase 3 validation)
- **Phase 5**: 2027+ (as research matures)
