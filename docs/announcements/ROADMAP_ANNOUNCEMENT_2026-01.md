## Hello, Community! 👋

First, **thank you** to everyone who has been using VerifiMind-PEAS. Over the past 7 days, our server logs show **19,542 requests** — including real MCP client connections from Claude Code and Claude Desktop users. This tells us the methodology is reaching real developers, and that means everything to us.

Today, we're sharing our **2026 Roadmap** and some important updates about the project's direction.

## 📊 Where We Are Today (v0.2.5)

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| GCP Cloud Run | ✅ Live at verifimind.ysenseai.org |
| Official MCP Registry | ✅ Listed |
| Smithery.ai | ✅ Available |
| HuggingFace Demo | ✅ Wisdom Canvas live |

**All 4 core tools are operational:**
- `genesis_validate` - Validate concepts through multi-model analysis
- `trinity_analyze` - Deep analysis with Y/X/Z perspectives
- `z_protocol_check` - Ethical compliance verification
- `reflexion_improve` - Iterative refinement suggestions

## 🗺️ The 2026 Roadmap

### v0.3.0: BYOK Enhancement (February 2026)
**The #1 requested feature!**

Full Bring Your Own Key support for multiple LLM providers:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5)
- Google (Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash)
- Groq (Llama, Mixtral)
- Mistral

**Why this matters:** You bring your own API keys, you control your costs, and we don't have to pay for your token consumption. This is how we stay sustainable as an open-source project.

### v0.4.0: Unified Prompt Templates (March 2026)
Export Genesis prompts as markdown/JSON to use with ANY LLM — even outside MCP.

### v0.5.0: Multi-Model Orchestration API (April-May 2026)
Single API endpoint that routes to multiple LLMs for true multi-model validation.

### v0.6.0: Local Model Support (June 2026)
Ollama and LM Studio integration for complete privacy and offline use.

## 💡 Our Philosophy

> **"The methodology is free. The convenience is optional."**

This is inspired by a simple truth: **education should be free, but consultation is personalized.**

| Free Forever | Optional (Future) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Genesis Methodology | Hosted infrastructure |
| MCP Server code | Priority support |
| Documentation | Custom integrations |
| Self-hosting | Training workshops |
| BYOK support | |

We're committed to keeping the core methodology open-source. If you want to self-host with your own API keys — it's 100% free, forever.
