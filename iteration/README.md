# Iteration Archive

Development iteration records, session handoffs, and internal analysis documents
have been moved to the private development repository as part of the
Dual-Repo Protocol v2.0 reorganization (February 2026).

## What Was Here

This directory previously contained 55+ files including:
- Session notes and handoff records
- Claude Code implementation guides
- Strategic assessments and research findings
- Multi-agent workflow protocols
- White paper drafts

## Why They Were Moved

These files contain internal development context that is more appropriate
for the private command hub repository. The public-facing documentation
remains in the `docs/` directory.

## For Contributors

If you need access to iteration history for contribution purposes,
please open an issue or contact the maintainer.
