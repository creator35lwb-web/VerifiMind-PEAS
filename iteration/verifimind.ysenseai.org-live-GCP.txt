● 📊 Current Deployment Status:

  Right now, the deployment is MANUAL - meaning:

  ❌ Updates DO NOT automatically deploy when you:
  - Push code to GitHub
  - Merge pull requests
  - Update features

  ✅ The domain stays live, but shows the old code until you manually redeploy.

  ---
  🔄 Two Options for Updates:

  Option 1: Manual Deployment (Current Setup)

  When you want to deploy updates:

  # 1. Navigate to mcp-server directory
  cd mcp-server

  # 2. Build and deploy to Cloud Run
  gcloud run deploy verifimind-mcp-server \
    --source . \
    --region us-central1 \
    --project ysense-platform-v4-1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated

  Pros:
  - ✅ Full control over when to deploy
  - ✅ Can test locally first
  - ✅ Simple to understand

  Cons:
  - ❌ Manual work required
  - ❌ Easy to forget to deploy
  - ❌ No automatic rollback

  ---
  Option 2: Automatic CI/CD (Recommended! 🚀)

  Set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy when you push to main:

  What it does:
  - ✅ Auto-deploys on every push to main branch
  - ✅ Runs tests before deploying
  - ✅ Updates https://verifimind.ysenseai.org automatically
  - ✅ Can rollback if deployment fails
  - ✅ Zero manual work!

  Workflow:
  Push code → GitHub → Run tests → Build Docker → Deploy to Cloud Run → Update live domain

  ---
  🎯 Would You Like Me To Set Up Auto-Deployment?

  I can create a GitHub Actions workflow that will:

  1. Trigger on push to main branch
  2. Run tests (if you have any)
  3. Build Docker image from your code
  4. Deploy to Cloud Run automatically
  5. Update the live domain instantly

  This means:
  - You push code to GitHub ✅
  - 5-10 minutes later → Live on https://verifimind.ysenseai.org ✅
  - No manual commands needed! ✅

  Setup time: ~10 minutes

  ---
  💡 My Recommendation:

  Set up automatic deployment! Because:
  1. You can keep improving features rapidly
  2. No manual deployment steps to remember
  3. Users always get latest version
  4. Professional deployment pipeline
  5. Easy rollback if something breaks

  Should I set this up for you now? I can create:
  1. .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Auto-deployment workflow
  2. Configure Google Cloud authentication
  3. Test the deployment pipeline
  4. Document how it works

  Would you like me to proceed with automatic deployment setup? 🚀

  Or do you prefer to stick with manual deployments for now?

> Great! and after this i might go back to Manus AI to continue enhance our code foundation and implementation
