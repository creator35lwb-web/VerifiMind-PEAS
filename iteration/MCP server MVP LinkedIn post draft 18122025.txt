Genesis Context Server Now Available! 🚀 MCP Server Proof-of-Concept



I'm thrilled to share that we've completed the first phase of our Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for VerifiMind-PEAS!



What is MCP?



Think of it as "USB-C for AI" - a universal standard for connecting AI applications to external tools and data. Anthropic created it, and it's now governed by the Linux Foundation with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads. And, inspiration blog shared by Smithery that we are about witnessing a fundamental shift in the internet’s economy - one in which tool calls are becoming the new clicks.



What We Built



The Genesis Context Server exposes our AI validation methodology through MCP Resources, enabling Claude Desktop to directly access:

• Genesis Master Prompt (the X-Z-CS Trinity framework)

• Validation history and results

• Project architecture and metadata



Why This Matters



Before: Copy-paste prompts, lose context between sessions, manual tracking.

After: Ask Claude "Show me the Genesis methodology" and it reads directly from your local server. Always current, always available.



The Bigger Picture



This is part of our vision to make AI validation accessible to everyone. The RefleXion Trinity (X-Z-CS) architecture ensures AI-generated ideas are validated through multiple perspectives:

• X Intelligent: Innovation analysis

• Z Guardian: Ethical review

• CS Security: Security validation



What's Next?

Week 3-4: Implement agent consultation tools

Week 5-6: Add state management for multi-turn workflows

Week 7-8: Community launch with comprehensive documentation



Open Source & Community

VerifiMind-PEAS is fully open-source (MIT license). We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration!
