  💡 My Recommendation:

  Set up automatic deployment! Because:
  1. You can keep improving features rapidly
  2. No manual deployment steps to remember
  3. Users always get latest version
  4. Professional deployment pipeline
  5. Easy rollback if something breaks

  Should I set this up for you now? I can create:
  1. .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Auto-deployment workflow
  2. Configure Google Cloud authentication
  3. Test the deployment pipeline
  4. Document how it works

  Would you like me to proceed with automatic deployment setup? 🚀
