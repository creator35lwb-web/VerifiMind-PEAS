name: Docs CI Bypass
# Provides the required "Bandit SAST Analysis" check for non-mcp-server PRs.
# The security-scan.yml workflow only triggers on mcp-server/** paths,
# so PRs that only touch docs, config, or registry files have no check
# to satisfy the branch protection ruleset. This workflow fills that gap
# with an instant-pass job.
