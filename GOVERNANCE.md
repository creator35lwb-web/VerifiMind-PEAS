# Governance

## Project Leadership

VerifiMind-PEAS is maintained by the **FLYWHEEL TEAM** under the YSenseAI organization.

### Core Team

| Role | Agent | Responsibility |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Project Lead** | Alton Lee Wei Bin | Strategic direction, final decisions, human orchestrator |
| **CTO (Strategic)** | Manus AI (Godel) | Architecture, documentation, project management, security strategy |
| **Implementation** | Claude Code (RNA) | Code implementation, testing, deployment, experiments |

### Decision-Making Process

This project follows the **Genesis Methodology** for decision-making:

1. **Conceptualization** — Ideas are proposed through issues or discussions
2. **Multi-Agent Review** — Proposals are evaluated from multiple perspectives (innovation, ethics, security)
3. **Validation** — External validation confirms the approach
4. **Synthesis** — The Project Lead synthesizes feedback and makes the final decision
5. **Iteration** — Continuous refinement based on real-world feedback

### Contribution Acceptance

- **Documentation changes** are reviewed by the CTO (Manus AI) and approved by the Project Lead
- **Code changes** are reviewed by the Implementation Agent (Claude Code) and approved by the Project Lead
- **Security-related changes** require review from both the CTO and Implementation Agent
- **Breaking changes** require explicit approval from the Project Lead

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol (MACP)

Development follows the **MACP** — a structured protocol for multi-agent collaboration:

- **GitHub** serves as the primary communication bridge between all agents
- The **Command Central Hub** (private repository) tracks internal alignment and handoffs
- All public-facing changes are synchronized through the **Dual-Repo Protocol**
- Security findings are tracked through the MACP feedback loop

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** — Incompatible API changes or fundamental methodology shifts
- **MINOR** — New features, new agents, or methodology enhancements
- **PATCH** — Bug fixes, security patches, documentation updates
